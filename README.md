## Objective
AeroSpectra is an AI/ML-powered platform designed to generate fine spatial resolution air quality maps, with a specific focus on NO₂ (Nitrogen Dioxide)
 concentrations. The platform processes satellite data and uses machine learning techniques to provide accurate NO₂ readings, even under cloudy conditions, ensuring comprehensive air quality monitoring.

## Key Features
- **Data Processing:** Integrates satellite data with advanced machine learning algorithms to create detailed NO₂ concentration maps.
- **Cloud Handling:** Implements techniques to estimate NO₂ levels in areas where cloud cover obstructs satellite detection.
- **User Interaction:** Users can search for specific locations, view real-time NO₂ concentrations, and interact with visual data on a map.
- **Real-Time Data Integration:** Provides live NO₂ concentration updates, allowing for enhanced situational awareness.
- **Visualization:** Displays data in an intuitive and interactive way using maps and charts, providing a user-friendly experience.

## Target Users
- Researchers
- Government bodies
- Environmental agencies
- Anyone requiring precise air quality data for analysis and decision-making

## Technologies Used
- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js)
- **Back-End:** Python (Flask), Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- **Mapping:** Leaflet.js for interactive maps, Folium for Python-based map generation
- **Data Processing:** Python for handling satellite, ground-level, and feature datasets
- **Model Training:** Random Forest model, achieving an approximate accuracy of 84%
- **Data Sources:** Sentinel-5P satellite data from Copernicus, accessed via the Sentinel website
- ## Result
